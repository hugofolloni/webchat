# webchat

## 🗒️ About this project
A simple webchat, with a unique room and on-page user rename tool. The user can choose the user that he will use and post whatever he want. That is a fully anonymous way of talk to each other.

## 🧔 User Story
On the page, the user can see previous messages on that room (the only one haha). He also can see two inputs, first one for the username he wants to use, and the second one the message input. After clicking the button send, the message is posted and the message input is blank again, allowing the user to post again.

## 💻 Technologies
- React
- JSON-server (to create the database)

## 🎨 UI
